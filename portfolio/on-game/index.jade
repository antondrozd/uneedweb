						p.section__text.section__text--on-game Due to the rise in popularity of mobile devices a sports betting company asked us to develop a mobile application. 
							span.section__text.section__text--hidden-on-mobile The project had to enable client’s audience to easily follow major sports’ updates, statistics, upcoming events, as well as to place a wager. The company’s audience already had a 5 million users, so the mobile application had to be compatible with the already existing website and moreover be convenient for the users. Based on client requirements, our team developed a technologically complex mobile application. Placing a wager through mobile app became the same simple as placing through the website. 
							| ON-GAME gained more than 120 million sessions per month. The ability to find and watch particular game highlights was implemented through an extension to existing IPTV software. ON-GAME also has integrated video batch downloading.
