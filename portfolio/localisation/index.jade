				h1.title Challenge accepted
				h2.sub-title To solve the problem of multiple languages our team developed an additional web application that managed projectâ€™s localization. The localization helper was an excellent tool to find untranslated or missing words/phrases in translations, securely protected content and prevented from damaging, pulled and gathered data that was previously stored in Google spreadsheets. It divided the users by their role and rights, tracked their activities and provided a back up for accumulated data.
